# Uniting LTER and iOOS Data Communities


This repository contains the tools/tutorials for pulling together LTER and iOOS Datasets for encouraging cross-talk between ecology, oceanography, and physics communities.

## What is the Challenge for this Hackweek Project?
There are a number of communities which have curated comprehensive datasets for environmental data. The data formats across these communities is not necessarily uniform in formatting/metadata standards, querying information is not necessarily straightforward for first time users, and discovering connections between these fields is obfuscated.

## Why is this a Challenge?
In terms of **engineering** the data, some of the challenge is querying and compiling the data into a usable and comprehensive set. There are a number of factors that need to be considered is nontrivial and the documentation maintained in the combination process.

In terms of **science** it is important to foster data discovery to encourage hypothesis development,  novel collaborations, and provide access to fundamental datastreams.

## Steps to Address
There are two key tools that need to be developed for a minimum viable product:
* __Data Combiner__: A tool that will allow a user to query specific datastreams of interest (time, region, fundmental topics) and will pull, unite, and provide meta-data about the stream(s)
* __Data Visualizer__: A tool that will read in the common frame, and will allow a user to specify the variables of interest, and will generate initial, interactive plots for discovery and exploration
